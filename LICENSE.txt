The MySelf License (Version 1.0)

Preamble:

This bio, henceforth referred to as "Bio," is a product of my quirky mind and is intended to spread smiles, laughter, and perhaps a snort or two. By accessing or using this Bio, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this license.

License:

1. You are hereby granted the right to chuckle, snicker, or burst into uncontrollable laughter at any portion of this Bio without restraint.

2. You are not only permitted but encouraged to share this Bio with friends, family, and even strangers (provided they have a good sense of humor) for the sole purpose of brightening their day.

3. If you happen to derive any monetary gain from the use of this Bio, congratulations! You are obligated to spend it on something that brings you genuine joy, whether it be a pizza party or a llama-themed onesie.

4. In the unlikely event of a disagreement over the interpretation of this license, the resolution shall be determined by a spontaneous dance-off, judged by a panel of inflatable flamingos.

5. Should you find this Bio less amusing than anticipated, you may request a refund in the form of a virtual hug, delivered with utmost sincerity.

Disclaimer:

This Bio is provided "as is," with no guarantees of side-splitting hilarity. The author shall not be held liable for any injuries sustained due to excessive laughter, snorting of beverages through the nose, or sudden outbreaks of giggles.

By using this Bio, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and wholeheartedly embraced the whimsical terms of the MySelf License.

Keep smiling!
