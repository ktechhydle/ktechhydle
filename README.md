# Hello, I'm Keller.
I am a full-time halfpipe snowboarder training in Colorado, but in my free time I program in Python and C++. I own and manage MP Software, and help develop open-source projects.

# About Me
> [!IMPORTANT]
> My programming journey started 8 months ago when I tried to show my brother what Python was. I got him on some tutorials (to which he didn't like) so I took his place and started learning, where I got into GUI programming with PyQt5 and Tkinter.
> I'm currently working on [MPRUN](https://github.com/ktechhydle/mprun_repo).

> [!TIP]
> If you ever feel like being real nice, buy me a Swiss Toblerone. The toblerone ***MUST*** be Swiss. I don't like the American Toblerone.
