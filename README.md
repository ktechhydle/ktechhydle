# Hello, I'm Keller.
In summary, I snowboard full-time, but in my free time I develop apps in Python. I work for MP Software in the summers developing open-source projects that help athletes, and hope to see a software of ours in development turn into something great. I am also learning C++, and can't wait to see where that takes me!

# About Me
> [!IMPORTANT]
> My programming journey started 7 months ago when I tried to show my brother what Python was. I got him on some tutorials (to which he didn't like) so I took his place and started learning, where I got into GUI programming with PyQt5 and Tkinter.
> I'm currently working on [MPRUN](https://github.com/ktechhydle/mprun_repo)

> [!TIP]
> If you ever feel like being real nice, buy me a Swiss Toblerone. The toblerone ***MUST*** be Swiss. I don't like the American Toblerone.
