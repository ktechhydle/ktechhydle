# Hello, I'm Keller.
I am a full-time halfpipe snowboarder training in Colorado, but in my free time I build applications. I run and manage MP Software, contributing to it's projects on the daily. 
My programming journey started a couple years ago when I tried to show my brother what Python was. I got him on some tutorials (to which he didn't like) so I took his place and 
started learning the language.
