# Hello, I'm Keller.
In summary, I snowboard full-time, but in my free time I develop apps in Python. I work for K-TECH Industries in the summers developing open-source projects, and hope to see a software of ours in development turn into something great.

# About Me
> [!IMPORTANT]
> My programming journey started 3 months ago when I tried to show my brother what Python was. I got him on some tutorials (to which he didn't like) so I took his place and started learning.
> Now I'm roughly 3 months into my journey and just got into GUI programming with PyQt5 and Tkinter.
> I'm currently working on MPRUN, and the `README` has plenty of info to help you understand exactly what the heck MPRUN is.

> [!TIP]
> If you ever feel like being real nice, buy me a Swiss Toblerone.

> [!CAUTION]
> The toblerone ***MUST*** be Swiss. I don't like the American Toblerone.
