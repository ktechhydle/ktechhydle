# Hello, I'm Keller.
I am a full-time halfpipe snowboarder training in Colorado, but in my free time I program in Python. My programming journey started 1 year ago when I tried to show my brother what Python was. I got him on some tutorials (to which he didn't like) so I took his place and started learning, where I got into GUI programming with PyQt5 and Tkinter. I'm currently working on [MPRUN](https://github.com/ktechhydle/mprun_repo).

# The MP Software Foundation Project
The MP Software Foundation Project is a project whose goal is to help on-snow athletes achieve success. Whether an athlete is trying to win a competition, learn a new trick, or get motivation, that's where the MP Software Foundation Project comes in. Our ultimate goal is to see over 100,000 athletes using our software by 2030. You can see the project goal tracker [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ibfl4VbTjPwA6yQpX8A0NwWhOQm74v5F46OdxKOGbcU/edit?usp=sharing).

> If you ever feel like being real nice, buy me a Swiss Toblerone. The toblerone ***MUST*** be Swiss. I don't like the American Toblerone.
